# Wisp Terraria Server

Q: What is this?

A: Its a terraria server system that doesn't require steam to be installed on the device to use.

Q: Why should I use this?

A: If you have an old laptop you can easily put this on a USB drive and send it to your old laptop and then run the server on it for your friends to play.

Q: How do I get my server IP?

A: Go to your command prompt and type in "ipconfig" then your IPv4 should be the IP of the server.

Q: What else can it do?

A: We have created super fast world generation, it will generate worlds much faster than if you load up the game to generate it.

Q: Is this still supported?

A: No, I have discontinued this project and started on the crossplay server.
